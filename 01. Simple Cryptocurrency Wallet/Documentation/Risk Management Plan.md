## Risk Monitoring and Review

1. **Regular Review Meetings**: Conduct weekly review meetings to assess the current risk status and discuss any new risks that have emerged.
2. **Risk Log**: Maintain a risk log to document identified risks, their status, and mitigation actions taken.
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Update the risk management plan based on lessons learned and feedback from the development process.

## Summary

By identifying, assessing, and prioritizing potential risks, and by implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, the project can minimize disruptions and ensure a successful development and deployment of the cryptocurrency wallet on the Ethereum blockchain.
