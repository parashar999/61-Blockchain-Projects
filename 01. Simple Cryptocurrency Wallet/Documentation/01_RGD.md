# Requirement Gathering Document for Cryptocurrency Wallet on Ethereum

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to gather and document the requirements for developing a basic cryptocurrency wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. This document will serve as a foundation for creating a detailed Requirement Specification Document (RSD).

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this project is to develop a secure and user-friendly cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to create wallets, store and manage keys, send and receive Ether, view transaction history, and check wallet balance. The application will be developed for the web platform.

## 2. Stakeholders
(Note: Since this is a practice project, the stakeholders are assumed to be the developer and potential users.)

- **Developer**: The individual responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the wallet application.
- **Users**: Individuals who will use the wallet to manage their Ether.

## 3. Sources of Requirements

1. **Existing Wallets**: Research features and functionalities of existing cryptocurrency wallets such as MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, and Trust Wallet.
2. **Blockchain Documentation**: Review Ethereum and Ethers.js documentation.
3. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from potential users through online forums and communities.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Wallet Creation
- Users should be able to create a new wallet with a public-private key pair.
- The wallet address and private key should be displayed upon creation.
- Users should have the option to save or export the private key securely.

### 4.2 Key Management
- The application should securely store private keys using local storage.
- Users should be able to import existing wallets by entering private keys.
- Private keys should not be exposed or transmitted insecurely.

### 4.3 Send and Receive Ether
- Users should be able to send Ether by entering the recipientâ€™s address and the amount.
- The application should calculate and display transaction fees before confirming the transaction.
- A confirmation screen should be provided before sending the transaction.
- Users should be able to receive Ether by displaying their wallet address.

### 4.4 Transaction History
- The application should display a list of past transactions, including date, amount, sender, and recipient.
- Detailed information for each transaction, such as transaction hash and status, should be provided.

### 4.5 Balance Inquiry
- The current balance of the wallet in ETH should be displayed.
- The balance should be periodically refreshed to reflect the latest status.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Security
- Private keys should be encrypted before storing.
- HTTPS should be used for secure communication between the client and server.
- Secure coding practices should be implemented to prevent vulnerabilities.

### 5.2 Performance
- The application should provide real-time balance updates.
- It should handle at least 100 transactions per second.

### 5.3 Usability
- The application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- Clear instructions and feedback for user actions should be provided.

### 5.4 Reliability
- The application should be available 99.9% of the time.
- Network failures should be handled gracefully, and operations should be retried as needed.

### 5.5 Compatibility
- The application should be compatible with major web browsers.

### 5.6 Maintainability
- The codebase should be modular and well-documented to facilitate maintenance and updates.
- Automated tests should be implemented to ensure reliability during updates.

### 5.7 Scalability
- The application should be able to handle an increasing number of users and transactions without performance degradation.

## 6. User Stories

### 6.1 Wallet Creation
- As a user, I want to create a new wallet so that I can manage my Ether securely.
- As a user, I want to see my wallet address and private key upon creation so that I can store them securely.

### 6.2 Key Management
- As a user, I want to import an existing wallet so that I can access my Ether from different devices.
- As a user, I want my private key to be stored securely so that it cannot be compromised.

### 6.3 Send and Receive Ether
- As a user, I want to send Ether to other addresses so that I can make transactions.
- As a user, I want to receive Ether from other addresses so that I can increase my balance.

### 6.4 Transaction History
- As a user, I want to see my past transactions so that I can keep track of my activity.
- As a user, I want detailed information about each transaction so that I can verify its status.

### 6.5 Balance Inquiry
- As a user, I want to see my current balance so that I know how much Ether I have.

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints

- Users have basic knowledge of cryptocurrency and Ethereum.
- Users have access to the internet.
- The application relies on third-party APIs and blockchain nodes.
- The development must be completed within 60 hours.
